Welcome to the homepage for the ECS "Computer Vision" modules [COMP3204](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP3204) and [COMP6223](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP6223).

The challenge of computer vision is to develop a computer based system with the capabilities of the human eye-brain system. It is therefore primarily concerned with the problem of capturing and making sense of digital images. The field draws heavily on many subjects including digital image processing, artificial intelligence, computer graphics and psychology.

This course will explore some of the basic principles and techniques from these areas which are currently being used in real-world computer vision systems and the research and development of new systems.

## Lectures
The lectures for this course will be given by [Professor Mark Nixon](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/msn) ([email](mailto:msn@ecs.soton.ac.uk)) and <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jsh2">Dr Jonathon Hare</a> ([email](mailto:jsh2@ecs.soton.ac.uk)). Mark will give the lectures for the first part of the course, and Jon will finish with the second half. 

There will be three lectures each week up to around the end of week 8; you'll then have about three weeks to work on your final coursework & Jon will make himself available in his office during the lecture slots of weeks 9 and 10 for anyone looking for help or guidance. We'll also likely throw in a couple of bonus lectures during the last weeks to cover additional material and give feedback. After the Christmas vacation we'll run a revision lecture and also give feedback (and prizes!) for the group coursework. 

The lecture slots are (currently) as follows -- keep an eye on your timetable for any changes:

Day       | Time | Room   
----------|------|-----------------------
Tuesdays  | 1PM  | 42/Cinema (SUSU Cinema)
Wednesdays| 10AM | 42/Cinema (SUSU Cinema)
Thursdays | 3PM  | 46/3001 (Physics L/T A)

## Lecture Materials
Materials to accompany the lectures can be found here:

* [Part 1](part1.html) taught by Mark.
* [Part 2](part2.html) taught by Jon.

## Assessment
This is a split exam and coursework module. The assessment weightings are slightly different for the UG and MSc variants of the module to reflect the different learning outcomes. Past exam papers can be [found on the web](https://www.adminservices.soton.ac.uk/adminweb/jsp/pastPapers/pastPapers.jsp) (hint search for "Computer Vision" rather than the module code to see a long list of historic, but largely still relevant, past papers).

### Coursework
The coursework assignments for COMP3204 and COMP6223 are slightly different. The schedule for each coursework is shown below, and details will become available below as each coursework is set. Deadline dates are currently provisional as deadlines might be moved by the Director of Programmes to minimise conflicts with other assignments from different modules:
